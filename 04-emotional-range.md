## Practice Notes

- **Emotional Range** requires full-body engagement — feelings live in breath, posture, and facial expression
- Record yourself: can you hear the emotional authenticity, or does it sound performed?
- Notice which emotions come naturally and which feel forced — practice the difficult ones more
- Real emotional range isn't about "acting" — it's about accessing genuine feeling states through memory and imagination
- Breath is the foundation: shallow/high for anxiety, full/low for confidence, interrupted for grief
- Some emotions require vocal "fry" or breathiness, others need clear tone — match vocal quality to feeling
- Transition exercises are hardest: give yourself time/space to shift between states
- Emotional blends require simultaneity — both feelings present at once, not sequentially
