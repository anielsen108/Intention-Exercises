## Practice Notes

- **Pedagogical modes** vary by learner autonomy, teacher direction, and knowledge construction
- Direct instruction (˥˩): clear, sequential, teacher-led (good for procedures, facts)
- Inquiry-based (˩˧): question-driven, learner-discovery (good for concepts, critical thinking)
- Collaborative (˨˦˨): peer learning, shared construction (good for complex problems)
- Tone matters: encouraging (˩˧˥) vs. discouraging profoundly affects learning
- Feedback should be specific, timely, and growth-oriented
- Balance praise (affirming effort) with challenge (raising standards)
- Metacognition (thinking about thinking) accelerates learning
