## Practice Notes

- **Social register** varies by formality, vocabulary, syntax, and pronunciation
- Formal (˨˦): complete sentences, Latinate words, precise diction
- Casual (˨˦˨): contractions, colloquialisms, relaxed pronunciation
- Intimate: fragments, private language, soft voice
- Code-switching is a skill: matching register to context
- Mismatched register alienates (too formal) or offends (too casual)
- Professional success often requires facility across registers
- Practice doesn't mean abandoning your authentic voice
