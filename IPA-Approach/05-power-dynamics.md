## Practice Notes

- **Power dynamics** largely conveyed through pitch range, volume, and finality of tone
- Higher status often uses more downward inflection (˥˩ statements, not questions)
- Lower status uses more rising inflection (˩˧ seeking approval, uncertain)
- Equal power maintains conversational, moderate pitch range (˨˦)
- Watch for physical correlates: posture, eye contact, gesture size
- Some power is explicit (rank, authority), some is negotiated moment-to-moment
- Practice reversals to understand how power feels from different positions
- Notice your default power position—do you habitually defer or dominate?
- Healthy communication often requires matching power levels appropriately
