## Practice Notes

- **Conflict navigation** requires emotional regulation and strategic communication
- Escalation patterns: volume increases, pitch rises (˩˧˥), tempo quickens
- De-escalation: soften voice (˨˦˨), slow pace, validate feelings
- "I" statements reduce defensiveness ("I feel X" vs. "You always Y")
- Repair attempts crucial: humor, affection, taking responsibility
- Practice staying physiologically calm (deep breathing) during conflict
- Cultural variations: direct vs. indirect conflict styles
- Healthy relationships navigate conflict; unhealthy ones avoid or weaponize it
