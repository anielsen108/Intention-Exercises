## Practice Notes

- **Certainty** expressed through pitch finality (˥˩), volume, and hedging language
- High certainty: downward pitch, firm consonants, declarative tone
- Low certainty: rising pitch (˩˧), softer voice, questioning tone
- Appropriate calibration crucial: overconfident or unnecessarily tentative both problematic
- Professional contexts may require confident presentation even with uncertainty
- Scientific thinking requires epistemic humility (acknowledging limits of knowledge)
- Certainty ≠ truth; practice honest assessment of what you actually know
- Cultural and gender patterns in hedging language
