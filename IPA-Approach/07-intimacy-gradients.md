## Practice Notes

- **Intimacy** in voice appears as softness, breathiness (˨˦˨), slower pace
- Distance uses clearer tone (˨˦), faster pace, formal language
- Mismatched intimacy feels uncomfortable—practice calibrating
- Breath matters: shallow/chest for distance, deep/belly for intimacy
- Volume: softer generally signals closeness
- Some cultures value formal distance, others warm closeness by default
- Professional settings require managing intimacy carefully
- Vulnerability must match relational safety level
- Practice appropriate boundaries while staying human
