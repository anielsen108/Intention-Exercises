## Practice Notes

- **Contrast is key**: Practice the pitch difference between clauses
- **Breath management**: Take brief pauses at clause boundaries
- **Intention clarity**: Each clause should have distinct emotional color
- **Pitch accuracy**: Use a tuner or pitch tracker to verify contours
- **Speed variation**: Try slow, medium, and conversational speeds

**Next Steps:** Progress to `03-three-clause-exercises.md` when you can smoothly navigate between contrasting pitch contours.
