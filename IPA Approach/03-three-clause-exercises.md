## Practice Notes

- **Narrative coherence**: Each three-clause sentence tells a story—feel the arc
- **Pitch mapping**: Track your pitch contours through all three clauses
- **Breath support**: Maintain energy through to the final clause
- **Intention clarity**: Each clause should have distinct emotional color
- **Transition smoothness**: Practice moving between contours without breaks
- **Recording**: Record yourself and listen for pitch accuracy on all three nuclear syllables

**Next Steps:** Explore specialized aspect pages (04-33) to deepen specific vocal skills.
