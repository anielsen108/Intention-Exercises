## Practice Notes

- **Temporal urgency** primarily expressed through tempo, volume, and pitch height
- Urgent (˥˩): faster, louder, higher pitch, clipped consonants
- Patient (˧˨): slower, softer, lower pitch, extended vowels
- Breathing patterns shift: rapid shallow (urgent) vs. deep slow (patient)
- Cultural variations: monochronic (time-focused) vs. polychronic (relationship-focused)
- Mismatched urgency creates friction (one rushing, one meandering)
- Practice matching urgency to situation (genuine emergency vs. manufactured panic)
- Chronic urgency exhausts—practice calm pacing as well as speed
