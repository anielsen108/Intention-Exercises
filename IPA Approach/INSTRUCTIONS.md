# Intention Exercises — Instructions (IPA Approach)

## Overview

This repository uses **IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) tone notation** to mark pitch contours on stressed syllables, helping performers develop precise control over vocal intention.

Unlike the ToBI approach (which marks abstract phonological categories), the IPA approach provides **direct phonetic transcription** of pitch movement using tone letters and diacritics.

## Core Methodology

### 1. **IPA Tone Letters**

IPA uses five tone levels and contour notation:

**Level Tones:**
- **˥** = extra high (tone 5)
- **˦** = high (tone 4)
- **˧** = mid (tone 3)
- **˨** = low (tone 2)
- **˩** = extra low (tone 1)

**Contour Tones (Combined):**
- **˩˥** = low-rising (1→5)
- **˥˩** = high-falling (5→1)
- **˨˦** = mid-rising (2→4)
- **˦˨** = falling-rising (4→2→4)
- **˩˧** = low-mid rising (1→3)
- **˧˥** = mid-high rising (3→5)
- **˩˧˥** = complex rise (1→3→5)

### 2. **Nuclear Syllable Marking**

Each clause has a **nuclear syllable** (the most prominent pitch movement). In our exercises:

1. The nuclear syllable appears in **bold brackets** with tone marks
2. Tone marks may appear **spaced** (˩ ˧ ˥) or **fused** (˩˧˥) depending on font rendering
3. We provide a **tone legend** after each clause: `[˩ ˧ ˥ => ˩˧˥]` showing both forms

**Example:**
```
Come [by˩˧], and leave [soon˥˩]. [˩ ˧ => ˩˧] [˥ ˩ => ˥˩]
```

### 3. **Exercise Format**

Each exercise follows this structure:

**Intention Label** — Sentence with IPA-marked nuclear syllables. Tone legends.

**Single-Clause Example:**
```
**Gentle encouragement** — Take your [time˨˦]. [˨ ˦ => ˨˦]
```

**Two-Clause Example:**
```
**Soft request, Firm finality** — Ask [now˩˧˥], but finish [then˥˩]. [˩ ˧ ˥ => ˩˧˥] [˥ ˩ => ˥˩]
```

**Three-Clause Example:**
```
**Hopeful-hurt-resigned** — I wanted to [stay˩˧], but she insisted I [leave˥˦], so I walked out [reluctantly˦˨]. [˩ ˧ => ˩˧] [˥ ˦ => ˥˦] [˦ ˨ => ˦˨]
```

### 4. **Common Pitch Contours and Their Intentions**

| Contour | IPA | Typical Intention |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| High fall | ˥˩ | Finality, certainty, commands |
| Low rise | ˩˧ or ˩˥ | Questions, invitations, politeness |
| Mid rise | ˨˦ | Continuation, listing, uncertainty |
| Rise-fall | ˩˥˩ | Emphasis, contrast, correction |
| Fall-rise | ˥˩˥ | Reservation, implicature, irony |
| Complex rise | ˩˧˥ | Urgency, pleading, excitement |
| Level high | ˥˥ | Suspension, non-finality |
| Level low | ˩˩ | Flatness, resignation, boredom |

### 5. **Font Rendering Note**

Many fonts automatically **combine** (ligate) sequential tone marks:
- Spaced: **˩ ˧ ˥** (three separate characters)
- Fused: **˩˧˥** (rendered as connected contour)

Both represent the same pitch movement. Our exercises show both forms for clarity: `[˩ ˧ ˥ => ˩˧˥]`

## Practice Recommendations

### Weekly Structure

**Week 1-2: Foundation**
- Practice 10 single-clause exercises daily
- Record yourself and compare pitch contours
- Focus on distinguishing ˥˩ (falling) from ˩˧ (rising)

**Week 3-4: Two-Clause Sentences**
- Add 5 two-clause exercises daily
- Practice contrasting intentions between clauses
- Example: soft request (˩˧˥) + firm refusal (˥˩)

**Week 5+: Complex Layering**
- Work with three-clause sentences
- Explore specialized aspects (one per week)
- Practice maintaining distinct pitch patterns across longer utterances

### Recording & Self-Assessment

1. **Record each variation** three times
2. **Listen back** and identify:
   - Is the nuclear syllable in the right place?
   - Does the pitch contour match the notation?
   - Can you distinguish the intentions?
3. **Use pitch analysis software** (optional):
   - Praat (free phonetics software)
   - Speech Analyzer
   - Your phone's pitch tracker apps

### Advanced Techniques

**Pitch Range Expansion:**
- Practice extreme contrasts: ˩˥ vs ˥˩
- Work on sustaining level tones: ˥˥, ˩˩
- Develop smooth contours on single syllables

**Speed Variation:**
- Slow practice: 2 seconds per syllable
- Conversational speed: 0.3-0.5 seconds per syllable
- Rapid fire: maintaining clarity at speed

**Combination Training:**
- Mix pitch with volume changes
- Add breath quality (breathy, pressed, modal)
- Layer tempo shifts with pitch contours

## Key Differences from ToBI Approach

| Aspect | ToBI | IPA |
|--------|------|-----|
| **Focus** | Phonological categories | Phonetic realization |
| **Precision** | Abstract pitch accents | Specific pitch contours |
| **Notation** | H*, L*, L+H* | ˥, ˩, ˩˧˥ |
| **Learning curve** | Requires linguistic training | More intuitive for musicians |
| **Use case** | Linguistic analysis | Performance/acting |

**Use ToBI when:** You want to understand the phonological system of English intonation.

**Use IPA when:** You want precise, reproducible pitch targets for performance.
