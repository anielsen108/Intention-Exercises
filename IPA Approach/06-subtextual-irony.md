## Practice Notes

- **Subtextual irony** relies heavily on tone contradicting literal meaning
- Sarcasm often uses flat affect (˥˩), elongated vowels, or exaggerated stress
- Understatement requires restraint—the gap between word and reality creates irony
- Dramatic irony needs audience awareness of context
- Cultural variations: British understatement vs. American sarcasm
- Facial expression is crucial—the "tell" that reveals true meaning
- Some irony is hostile (mockery), some is defensive (self-protection)
- Master sincere delivery first (˩˧˥), then learn to subvert it (˥˩)
- Overuse breeds cynicism—deploy strategically
