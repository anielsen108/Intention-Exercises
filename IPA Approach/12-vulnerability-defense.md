## Practice Notes

- **Vulnerability** is exposure to emotional risk; **defense** is protection from harm
- Both necessary: complete openness (˩˧˥˩) = unsafe; total defense (˥˩) = isolated
- Healthy relationships create safety for vulnerability
- Defense mechanisms: deflection, minimizing, intellectualizing, aggression
- Vulnerability requires assessing safety first
- Shame silences; guilt motivates repair
- Cultural variations: some cultures value stoicism, others emotional expression
- Vulnerability ≠ oversharing; appropriate disclosure builds intimacy
- Practice discernment: with whom, when, how much to open
