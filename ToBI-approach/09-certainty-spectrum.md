### 93-100. [Additional certainty spectrum exercises...]

**Note:** Exercises 93-100 would explore:
- Hedging language ("sort of," "kind of," "in a way")
- Epistemic markers ("I believe," "it seems," "apparently")
- Confidence calibration (matching certainty to evidence)
- Overconfidence vs. underconfidence
- Cultural variations in expressing certainty
- Gender differences in hedging
- Professional vs. personal certainty displays
- Moving between certainty levels as evidence changes

---

## Practice Notes

- **Certainty** expressed through pitch finality, volume, and hedging language
- High certainty: downward pitch, firm consonants, declarative tone
- Low certainty: rising pitch, softer voice, questioning tone
- Appropriate calibration crucial: overconfident or unnecessarily tentative both problematic
- Women often socialized to hedge more; men to assert more (cultural patterns)
- Professional contexts may require confident presentation even with uncertainty
- Scientific thinking requires epistemic humility (acknowledging limits of knowledge)
- Certainty ≠ truth; practice honest assessment of what you actually know

## Integration

Use these exercises to:
1. Calibrate claims to actual confidence level
2. Communicate uncertainty without appearing weak
3. Assert views confidently when warranted
4. Maintain epistemic humility
5. Navigate professional communication effectively
6. Build trust through honest uncertainty
7. Avoid overconfidence and underconfidence
