## Practice Notes

- **Enthusiasm** expressed through: pitch range (wider = more), tempo (faster = more), volume (louder = more), vowel quality (brighter = more)
- **Apathy** shows as: narrow pitch, slow tempo, soft volume, dark vowels
- **Appropriate calibration** crucial: too much enthusiasm seems fake; too little seems rude
- Physical embodiment: enthusiasm lives in the body (posture, gesture, facial expression)
- Sustaining enthusiasm requires genuine interest (fake enthusiasm exhausts)
- Cultural differences: some cultures reward restraint, others value expressiveness
- Professional contexts often require moderate enthusiasm (not extreme)
- Depression/exhaustion affect capacity for enthusiasm
