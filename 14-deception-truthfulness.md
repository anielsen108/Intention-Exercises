## Practice Notes

- **Deception detection** relies on vocal tells: pitch changes, hesitations, over-explanation, lack of detail
- **Honest speech** tends to be direct, detailed, contextual, emotionally congruent
- **White lies** serve social function but blur ethical lines
- **Evasion** avoids direct lying while concealing truth
- **Active lying** requires cognitive load (often betrayed by prosody)
- Cultural variations: some cultures value indirect communication (not deception)
- Professional contexts may require strategic ambiguity
- Self-deception: voice reflects our own belief (even if false)
- Ethical practice: Use these exercises to understand deception, not to harm
