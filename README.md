# Intention Exercises Repository

A comprehensive vocal intention training system with **6,000+ exercises** exploring prosody, intonation, and delivery variations across 30 specialized aspects of human communication.

## Two Complete Approaches

This repository offers two parallel methodologies for developing vocal intention:

### **ToBI Approach** (Tones and Break Indices)
Linguistic notation system marking abstract phonological categories. Ideal for understanding the phonological structure of English intonation.

**Located in:** `ToBI approach/` folder

### **IPA Approach** (International Phonetic Alphabet)
Direct phonetic transcription using five-level tone notation. Ideal for precise, reproducible pitch targets in performance.

**Located in:** `IPA Approach/` folder

---

## Which Approach Should I Use?

| Aspect | ToBI Approach | IPA Approach |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Notation** | H*, L*, L+H*, etc. | ˥, ˩, ˩˧˥, etc. |
| **Focus** | Phonological patterns | Phonetic pitch contours |
| **Best For** | Linguistic analysis, pattern recognition | Performance, acting, precise pitch control |
| **Learning Curve** | Requires linguistic background | More intuitive for musicians |
| **Precision** | Abstract categories | Exact pitch levels (1-5) |

**Choose ToBI** if you want to understand intonational phonology.
**Choose IPA** if you want precise performance targets.
**Use both** for comprehensive mastery.
