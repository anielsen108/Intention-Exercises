# Intention Exercises Repository

A comprehensive vocal intention training system with 3,000+ exercises exploring prosody, intonation, and delivery variations across 30 specialized aspects of human communication.

## Overview

This repository provides systematic practice for developing vocal flexibility and intention clarity. Each exercise presents the same text delivered with three distinct intentions, teaching practitioners to shift prosody, tempo, and tonal qualities to convey precise communicative aims.

### Core Methodology

Every exercise includes:
- **ToBI Notation** (Tones and Break Indices) for intonation patterns
- **Stress Markers** indicating emphasized/extended words
- **Pause Structure** showing major/minor breaks and smooth connections
- **Three Intention Variations** demonstrating distinct emotional/communicative approaches

## Practice Recommendations

### Weekly Rhythm
- **Weeks 1-4:** General short phrases (foundation)
- **Weeks 5-8:** Two-clause sentences (layering)
- **Weeks 9-12:** Three-clause sentences (complexity)
- **Week 13+:** Rotate through specialized aspects

### Daily Practice (2 minutes per exercise)
1. Stand, breathe low; one silent inhale per take
2. Mark one key word each time
3. Keep timing consistent (≈1.8-2.2s per take)
4. Record three takes as single clip
5. Listen back: can you identify intentions blind?

### Progression Strategy
1. Master one aspect before adding another
2. Practice same exercise weekly to track growth
3. Use mirror to catch facial expressions
4. Notice which intentions feel natural vs. difficult
5. Build from authentic feeling states, not performance

### Integration Methods
- Solo recording and self-assessment
- Partner practice with blind identification
- Contextual application in real conversations
- Performance work (monologues, presentations)
- Teaching/coaching others

## Notation Reference

### ToBI Pitch Accents
- **H\*** = high pitch accent (prominence)
- **L\*** = low pitch accent
- **L+H\*** = rise to prominence
- **H+L\*** = fall from prominence
- **!H\*** = downstepped high (less prominent than previous H*)

### Boundary Tones
- **L-L%** = low phrase tone + low boundary (falling finality)
- **L-H%** = low phrase tone + high boundary (rising, questioning)
- **H-H%** = high phrase tone + high boundary (continuation rise)

### Pause Structure
- **//** = major pause (break index 4)
- **/** = minor pause (break index 3)
- **,** = slight pause/hesitation (break index 2)
- No mark = smooth connection (break index 1)

### Stress Notation
- **CAPS** = primary stress on this word
- **bold** = extended/lengthened word
- *Italics* = lighter/de-emphasized

## Pedagogical Approach

This repository teaches vocal intention through:

1. **Systematic Variation** - Same text, different deliveries reveals prosodic elements
2. **Explicit Notation** - ToBI, stress, pause make implicit patterns explicit
3. **Holistic Integration** - Physical, emotional, cognitive elements unified
4. **Progressive Complexity** - Foundation → layering → mastery
5. **Domain Coverage** - 30 aspects span full range of human communication
6. **Authentic Practice** - Real feeling states, not mechanical performance
7. **Self-Assessment** - Recording and reflection build metacognitive awareness

## Repository Philosophy

**Intention is not performance.** This work develops authentic vocal expression grounded in genuine internal states, not surface-level acting. The goal is congruence: your voice accurately reflecting your actual intention, whether in art or life.

**Prosody is meaning.** The same words with different intonation convey entirely different messages. Mastering prosodic variation expands your communicative power exponentially.

**Practice reveals patterns.** Recording yourself makes unconscious habits conscious. What you discover about your voice teaches you about yourself.

**Flexibility serves authenticity.** Developing range doesn't make you inauthentic—it gives you more tools to express your true self accurately across diverse contexts.

---

**Begin your intention practice journey. Your voice is waiting to reveal its full expressive potential.**
