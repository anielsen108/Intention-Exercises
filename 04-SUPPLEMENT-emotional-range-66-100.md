- **Flexibility**: Moving fluidly between states
- **Complexity**: Holding multiple feelings simultaneously
- **Honesty**: Distinguishing real from performed emotion
- **Regulation**: Managing overwhelming feelings
- **Expression**: Communicating emotion clearly

The goal isn't emotional control in service of suppression, but emotional fluency in service of authentic communication.
