## Practice Notes

- Sarcasm often uses flat affect, elongated vowels, or exaggerated stress
- Understatement requires restraint — the gap between word and reality creates irony
- Dramatic irony needs audience awareness of context
- Cultural variations: British understatement vs. American sarcasm vs. other traditions
- Facial expression is crucial — the "tell" that reveals true meaning
- Some irony is hostile (mockery), some is defensive (self-protection)
- Master sincere delivery first, then learn to subvert it
- Overuse breeds cynicism — deploy strategically
