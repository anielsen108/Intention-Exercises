## Practice Notes

- **Power dynamics** are largely conveyed through pitch range, volume, and finality of tone
- Higher status often uses more downward inflection (statements, not questions)
- Lower status uses more rising inflection (seeking approval, uncertain)
- Equal power maintains conversational, moderate pitch range
- Watch for physical correlates: posture, eye contact, gesture size
- Some power is explicit (rank, authority), some is negotiated moment-to-moment
- Practice reversals to understand how power feels from different positions
- Notice your default power position — do you habitually defer or dominate?
- Healthy communication often requires matching power levels (neither dominating nor submitting unnecessarily)

## Integration

Use these exercises to:
1. Navigate professional hierarchies with appropriate tone
2. Assert boundaries without aggression
3. Yield power gracefully when appropriate
4. Collaborate as genuine equals
5. Recognize and resist manipulation
6. Develop leadership presence
7. Understand how vocal power affects relationships
