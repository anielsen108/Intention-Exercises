# Intention Exercises — Instructions

## Core Exercise Format

Each item keeps the same text but flips vocal placement, tempo, and tonal center through three sharply distinct intentions.

**Example:** "I thought you'd say that."

Repeat it three times without changing any words, only your delivery:

1. **Authoritative** → firm pace, decisive downstep at "that," minimal smile.
2. **Inviting** → lighter onset, warmer timbre, slight rise on "say," soft landing.
3. **Informative** → even tempo, neutral pitch arc, clear but uncolored emphasis on "say."

Record the three takes once a week as a single clip so you can hear your prosody pivot cleanly between aims.

## How to Run It (2 minutes)

1. **Stand, breathe low** — one silent inhale per take.
2. **Mark one key word each time** (e.g., "thought," "you'd," "say") but keep the text identical.
3. **Keep timing consistent** (≈1.8–2.2s per take) so intention, not tempo drift, does the work.
4. **Listen back:** Can you label the three intentions blind? If not, exaggerate the contrast next week.

## Optional Micro-Tweaks

- **Authoritative:** narrower pitch span, final fall ↘ on "that."
- **Inviting:** gentle rise ↗ on "say," micro-smile to brighten vowels.
- **Informative:** midline pitch, equal syllable weight, crisp but unhurried consonants.

## Exercise Notation Guide

For each exercise sentence, you'll find:

### 1. **ToBI Intonation Notation**
ToBI (Tones and Break Indices) describes pitch accents and boundary tones:
- **H\*** = high pitch accent (prominence)
- **L\*** = low pitch accent
- **L+H\*** = rise to prominence
- **H+L\*** = fall from prominence
- **L-L%** = low phrase tone + low boundary (falling finality)
- **L-H%** = low phrase tone + high boundary (rising, questioning)
- **H-H%** = high phrase tone + high boundary (continuation rise)
- **!H\*** = downstepped high (less prominent than previous H*)

### 2. **Stress and Extension**
- **CAPS** = primary stress on this word
- **bold** = extended/lengthened word
- *Italics* may indicate lighter or de-emphasized words

### 3. **Pause Structure**
- **//** = major pause (break index 4)
- **/** = minor pause (break index 3)
- **,** = slight pause or hesitation (break index 2)
- No mark = smooth connection (break index 1)

## Example with Full Notation

**"I thought you'd say that."**

### Authoritative
- **ToBI:** H* L* L* H+L* L-L%
- **Stress:** I **THOUGHT** you'd say **THAT**
- **Pause:** I thought / you'd say **that**.
- Firm pace, decisive downstep at "that," minimal smile.

### Inviting
- **ToBI:** L* H* L+H* H* L-H%
- **Stress:** I thought **YOU'D** say that
- **Pause:** I thought , you'd **say** that.
- Lighter onset, warmer timbre, slight rise on "say," soft landing.

### Informative
- **ToBI:** L* H* L* H* L-L%
- **Stress:** I thought you'd **SAY** that
- **Pause:** I thought you'd say that.
- Even tempo, neutral pitch arc, clear but uncolored emphasis on "say."

## Weekly Practice Rhythm

- **Week 1-4:** General short phrases (build foundation)
- **Week 5-8:** Two-clause sentences (layer intentions)
- **Week 9-12:** Three-clause sentences (complex prosody)
- **Week 13+:** Rotate through specialized aspects

Track your progress. Notice which intention contrasts come naturally and which require deliberate shaping.
