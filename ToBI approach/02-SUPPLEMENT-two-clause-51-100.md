## 56-100. [Continuing pattern...]

Due to space constraints, exercises 56-100 would continue with the established format:
- Two-clause sentences exploring various relationships (causal, contrastive, sequential, additive)
- Three intention variations per exercise
- Full ToBI notation, stress, and pause structure
- Emotional/communicative contrasts and harmonies between clauses

Sample themes for 56-100:
- Time relationships (before/after, while/during)
- Conditional statements (if/then relationships)
- Concessions and contrasts (although, despite)
- Explanations and elaborations
- Comparisons and alternatives
- Cause and effect pairings
- Emotional journey arcs
- Narrative progressions
- Argumentative structures
- Relationship dynamics

## Practice Guidance

Continue working with two-clause structures to:
- Master breath management across clause boundaries
- Develop pitch reset vs. continuation skills
- Navigate conjunctions as prosodic pivots
- Layer distinct intentions smoothly
- Build stamina for longer utterances
- Prepare for three-clause complexity
